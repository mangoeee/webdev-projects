# Markdown Blog Using Node.js, Express, And MongoDB

## Purpose
    I wanted to see if I was up for the challenge of a full-stack type of project and, as of 01APR2023, I'm not (LOL). Hopefully I'll come back to this in the future and figure out the problem.

## Bugs
    When submitting a new article, the page loads forever and ever until eventually crashing and spewing out the error. What's causing this? I'm not even sure, but I THINK it may have something to do with the articles.js file and the router.post function in there. Who knows? (Hopefully future Emery)
